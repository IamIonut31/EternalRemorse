My love, I'm sorry, but i can't live another day without you. Every day feels so empty without you. I know you wanted me to live a happy life 
even without you, but i cant...
If I didn't leave the house for that case, maybe you would still be alive now, but you aren't so I can't go on...
I'm sorry... my love... we will meet soon ...
